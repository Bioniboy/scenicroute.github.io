1. First-line Support is available primarily on our Discord server <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/8VkDrfq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dylan Perry Discord Server <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-labelledby="svg-external-link-title" width="1em" height="1em"><use xlink:href="#svg-external-link"></use></svg></a>. It is great for support, troubleshooting, and reporting bugs since you can speak with staff and other users in real-time. We have many regular users offering help to new players. The Discord is also a good place to meet fellow adventurers and chat about Wildlander and other games.
1. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildlander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wildlander Subreddit <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-labelledby="svg-external-link-title" width="1em" height="1em"><use xlink:href="#svg-external-link"></use></svg></a> is a great place to meet fellow players and share stories of your adventures. We also host community events, post screenshots of our characters’ latest exploits, and generally discuss whatever we like through Reddit’s forum-style posting. You can also use the Subreddit for tech support, but the Discord is better for real-time help and troubleshooting.
1. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/wildlander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wildlander YouTube channel <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-labelledby="svg-external-link-title" width="1em" height="1em"><use xlink:href="#svg-external-link"></use></svg></a> contains a variety of Wildlander video content, including gameplay videos, gameplay tutorials, developer updates, modding tutorials, and other video content not related to Wildlander.
